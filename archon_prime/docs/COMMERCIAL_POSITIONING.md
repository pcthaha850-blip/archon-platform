# ARCHON PRIME - Commercial Positioning

## Executive Summary

**ARCHON PRIME** is an institutional-grade signal execution platform that brings hedge fund-level risk management and trade execution to retail and semi-institutional traders.

**One-Line Positioning:**
> *"Institutional risk controls. Retail accessibility. Your edge, protected."*

---

## Market Position

### The Problem

Retail traders face a fundamental disadvantage:

1. **Execution Without Protection** — Most retail platforms offer raw market access with no systematic risk controls
2. **Signal Waste** — Good trading ideas fail due to poor execution timing, over-sizing, and emotional interference
3. **No Audit Trail** — When trades go wrong, there's no way to understand why
4. **Manual Intervention Bias** — Human emotions corrupt systematic strategies

### The Solution

ARCHON PRIME provides:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Signal Gate** | Every signal passes through a 5-check consensus gate before execution |
| **Position Sizing** | Kelly Criterion with CVaR-adjusted sizing protects capital |
| **Panic Hedge** | Automatic hedging during flash crashes and volatility spikes |
| **Kill Switch** | Emergency stop with sub-second activation |
| **Full Provenance** | Every trade has a complete decision chain with SHA256 verification |
